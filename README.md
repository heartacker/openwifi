## Download img and Quick start

- Download [openwifi img](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12egFLT9TclmY8m3vCMHmUuSne3qK0SWc/view?usp=sharing), unzip and burn it into a SD card (>=16GB). After this operation, the SD card should have two partitions: BOOT and rootfs. To flash the SD card, SD card tool software (such as Startup Disk Creator in Ubuntu) or dd command can be used:

  ```bash
  sudo dd bs=512 count=31116288 if=openwifi-xyz.img of=/dev/your_sdcard_dev
  (To have correct count value, better to check the .img file actual situation by "fdisk -l img_filename")
  ```
- Config the **correct files in the BOOT partition** according to the **board you have** by operation on your computer:

  - Copy files in **BOOT/openwifi/board_name** to the base directory of BOOT partition.
  - Delete the **rootfs/root/kernel_modules** directory (if exist).
  - Delete the **rootfs/etc/network/interfaces.new** directory (if exist).
- Insert the SD card to the board. Configure the board in SD booting mode. Connect antennas. Power on.
- Login to the board from your PC (PC Ethernet should have IP 192.168.10.1) with password **openwifi**.

  ```bash
  ssh root@192.168.10.122
  ```
- If not successful, check [known issue](doc/known_issue/notter.md)
- Then, run openwifi AP and the on board webserver

  ```bash
  raspi-config --expand-rootfs (Only needed when your SD card > 16GB. Run and reboot)
  ./openwifi/setup_once.sh (Reboot the board. Only need to run once for new board)
  cd openwifi
  ./wgd.sh
  ./fosdem.sh
  (Use "./wgd.sh 1" to enable experimental AMPDU aggregation on top of 11n)
  (Use "./fosdem-11ag.sh" to force 11a/g mode)
  ```

  **NOTE** adrv9361z7035 has ultra low TX power in 5GHz. Move **CLOSER** when you use that board in 5GHz!!!
- After you see the "openwifi" SSID on your device (Phone/Laptop/etc), connect it (If not get 192.168.13.* IP automatically, check [known issue](doc/known_issue/notter.md)). Browser to 192.168.13.1 on your device, you should see the webpage hosted by the webserver on board.

  - Note 1: If your device doesn't support 5GHz (ch44), please change the **hostapd-openwifi.conf** on board and re-run fosdem.sh.
  - Note 2: After ~2 hours, the Viterbi decoder will halt (Xilinx Evaluation License). Just reload FPGA ([method](doc/app_notes/drv_fpga_dynamic_loading.md)) or simply power cycle the board if it happens. (If output of "./sdrctl dev sdr0 get reg rx 20" is always the same, it means the decoder halts)
- To give the Wi-Fi client internet access, configure routing/NAT **on the PC**:

  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
  sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o NICY -j MASQUERADE
  sudo ip route add 192.168.13.0/24 via 192.168.10.122 dev ethX
  ```

  **ethX** is the PC NIC name connecting the board ethernet. **NICY** is the PC NIC name connecting internet (WiFi or another ethernet).

  If you want, uncommenting "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" in /etc/sysctl.conf to make IP forwarding persistent on PC.
- To monitor **real-time CSI (Chip State Information)**, such as timestamp, frequency offset, channel state, equalizer, please refer to [[CSI notes](doc/app_notes/csi.md)].

## Basic operations

The board actually is an Linux/Ubuntu computer which is running **hostapd** to offer Wi-Fi AP functionality over the Wi-Fi Network Interface (NIC). The NIC is implemented by openwifi-hw FPGA design. We use the term **"On board"** to indicate that the commands should be executed after ssh login to the board. **"On PC"** means the commands should run on PC.

- Bring up the openwifi NIC sdr0:
  ```bash
  cd ~/openwifi && ./wgd.sh
  (Use "./wgd.sh 1" to enable experimental AMPDU aggregation)
  ```
- Use openwifi as client to connect other AP (Change wpa-connect.conf on board firstly):
  ```bash
  route del default gw 192.168.10.1
  wpa_supplicant -i sdr0 -c wpa-connect.conf &
  dhclient sdr0
  ```
- Use openwifi in ad-hoc mode: Please check **sdr-ad-hoc-up.sh**, **sdr-ad-hoc-join.sh** and [this app note](./doc/app_notes/ad-hoc-two-sdr.md).
- Use openwifi in monitor mode: Please check **monitor_ch.sh** and [this app note](./doc/app_notes/inject_80211.md).
- The Linux native Wi-Fi tools/Apps (iwconfig/ifconfig/iwlist/iw/hostapd/wpa_supplicant/etc) can run over openwifi NIC in the same way as commercial Wi-Fi chip.
- **sdrctl** is a dedicated tool to access openwifi driver/FPGA, please check [project document](./doc/README.md) for more information.

## Update FPGA

Since the pre-built SD card image might not have the latest bug-fixes/updates, it is recommended to always copy the latest files in the [user_space](./user_space) directory on to the board. Then update the FPGA&Driver according to the Quick start of [this app note](doc/app_notes/radar-self-csi.md#quick-start). Following instructions are doing the same thing with extra info for environment setup.

(Check [Driver and FPGA dynamic reloading app note](./doc/app_notes/drv_fpga_dynamic_loading.md) for better understanding of updating FPGA and driver files without rebooting/power-cycle)

- Install Vivado 2021.1. Make sure install Vitis as well. You should have this directory: your_Xilinx_install_directory/Vitis (NOT Vitis_HLS!)
  - If the Vitis is not installed, you can add it by running "Xilinx Design Tools --> Add Design Tools for Devices 2021.1" from Xilinx program group/menu in your OS start menu.
- Setup environment variables (use absolute path):
  ```bash
  export XILINX_DIR=your_Xilinx_install_directory
  (Example: export XILINX_DIR=/opt/Xilinx. The Xilinx directory should include sth like: Downloads, Vitis, etc.)
  export OPENWIFI_HW_IMG_DIR=your_openwifi-hw-img_directory
  (The directory where you get the open-sdr/openwifi-hw-img repo via git clone)
  export BOARD_NAME=your_board_name
  ```
- Pick the FPGA bitstream from openwifi-hw-img, generate system_top.bit.bin and transfer it on board via ssh channel:
  ```bash
  cd openwifi/user_space; ./boot_bin_gen.sh $XILINX_DIR $BOARD_NAME $OPENWIFI_HW_IMG_DIR/boards/$BOARD_NAME/sdk/system_top.xsa
  scp ./system_top.bit.bin root@192.168.10.122:openwifi/
  ```
- Now the system_top.bit.bin is onboard in /root/openwifi/ directory. When wgd.sh runs onboard from that directory, it will discover the FPGA img file system_top.bit.bin and load it before loading driver .ko files.

## Update Driver

Since the pre-built SD card image might not have the latest bug-fixes/updates, it is recommended to always copy the latest files in the [user_space](./user_space) directory on to the board. Then update the FPGA&Driver according to the Quick start of [this app note](doc/app_notes/radar-self-csi.md#quick-start). Following instructions are doing the same thing with extra info for environment setup.

(Check [Driver and FPGA dynamic reloading app note](./doc/app_notes/drv_fpga_dynamic_loading.md) for better understanding of updating FPGA and driver files without rebooting/power-cycle)

- Prepare Analog Devices Linux kernel source code (only need to run once):

  ```bash
  sudo apt install flex bison libssl-dev device-tree-compiler u-boot-tools -y
  cd openwifi/user_space; ./prepare_kernel.sh $XILINX_DIR $ARCH_BIT
  (For Zynq 7000, ARCH_BIT should be 32, for Zynq MPSoC, ARCH_BIT should be 64)
  ```
- Compile the latest openwifi driver

  ```bash
  cd openwifi/driver; ./make_all.sh $XILINX_DIR $ARCH_BIT
  (For Zynq 7000, ARCH_BIT should be 32, for Zynq MPSoC, ARCH_BIT should be 64)
  (More arguments (max 5) beyond above two will be converted to "#define argument" in pre_def.h for conditional compiling)
  ```
- Copy the driver files to the board via ssh channel

  ```bash
  cd openwifi/driver; scp `find ./ -name \*.ko` root@192.168.10.122:openwifi/
  ```

  Now you can use **wgd.sh** on board to load the new openwifi driver. **wgd.sh** also tries to reload FPGA img if system_top.bit.bin presents in the same directory.
  Find more information in [Driver and FPGA dynamic reloading app note](./doc/app_notes/drv_fpga_dynamic_loading.md).

  **Note**: If you have symbol or version error while loadng the driver, it could be because the kernel in the SD card image is too old. In this case, you need put the linux kernel image generated by prepare_kernel.sh (check [[Update Driver](#Update-Driver)]) to the BOOT partition of SD card. The kernel image file name: adi-linux/arch/arm/boot/uImage (32bit); adi-linux-64/arch/arm64/boot/Image (64bit).

## Update sdrctl

- Copy the sdrctl source files to the board via ssh channel

  ```bash
  cd openwifi/user_space/sdrctl_src; scp `find ./ -name \*` root@192.168.10.122:openwifi/sdrctl_src/
  ```
- Compile the sdrctl **on board**:

  ```bash
  cd ~/openwifi/sdrctl_src/ && make clean && make && cp sdrctl ../ && cd ..
  ```

## Easy Access and etc

- Check [Driver and FPGA dynamic reloading app note](./doc/app_notes/drv_fpga_dynamic_loading.md) for more convenient way of updating FPGA and driver files without rebooting/power-cycle.
- FPGA and driver on board update scripts
  - Setup [ftp server](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-ftp) on PC, allow anonymous and change ftp root directory to the openwifi directory.
  - On board:

  ```bash
  ./sdcard_boot_update.sh $BOARD_NAME
  (Above command downloads uImage, BOOT.BIN and devicetree.dtb, then copy them into boot partition. Remember to power cycle)
  ./wgd.sh remote
  (Above command downloads driver files, and brings up sdr0)
  ```
- Access the board disk/rootfs like a disk:
  - On PC: "File manager --> Connect to Server...", input: sftp://root@192.168.10.122/root
  - Input password "openwifi"

## Build openwifi Linux img from scratch

- For the latest ADI Kuiper image, please check [kuiper.md](./doc/img_build_instruction/kuiper.md)

## Special note for 11b

Openwifi only applies OFDM as its modulation scheme and as a result, it is not backward compatible with 802.11b clients or modes of operation. This is usually the case during beacon transmission, connection establishment, and robust communication.

As a solution to this problem, openwifi can be fully controlled only if communicating with APs/clients instantiated using hostapd/wpa_supplicant userspace programs respectively.

For hostapd program, 802.11b rates can be suppressed using configuration commands (i.e. supported_rates, basic_rates) and an example configuration file is provided (i.e. hostapd-openwifi.conf). One small caveat to this one comes from fullMAC Wi-Fi cards as they must implement the *NL80211_TXRATE_LEGACY* NetLink handler at the device driver level.

On the other hand, the wpa_supplicant program on the client side (commercial Wi-Fi dongle/board) cannot suppress 802.11b rates out of the box in 2.4GHz band, so there will be an issue when connecting openwifi (OFDM only). A patched wpa_supplicant should be used at the client side.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0-dev
cd openwifi/user_space; ./build_wpa_supplicant_wo11b.sh
```

## Porting guide

This section explains the porting work by showing the differences between openwifi and Analog Devices reference design. openwifi is based on 2021_r1 of [HDL Reference Designs](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl).

- Open the fmcomms2 + zc706 reference design at hdl/projects/fmcomms2/zc706 (Please read Analog Devices help)
- Open the openwifi design zc706_fmcs2 at openwifi-hw/boards/zc706_fmcs2 (Please read openwifi-hw repository)
- "Open Block Design", you will see the differences between openwifi and the reference design. Both in "diagram" and in "Address Editor".
- The address/interrupts of FPGA blocks hooked to the ARM bus should be put/aligned to the devicetree file openwifi/kernel_boot/boards/zc706_fmcs2/devicetree.dts. Linux will parse the devicetree.dtb when booting to know information of attached device (FPGA blocks in our case).
- We use dtc command to get devicetree.dts converted from devicetree.dtb in [Analog Devices Linux image](https://wiki.analog.com/resources/tools-software/linux-software/zynq_images), then do modification according to what we have added/modified to the reference design.
- Please learn the script in [[Build openwifi Linux img from scratch](#Build-openwifi-Linux-img-from-scratch)] to understand how we generate devicetree.dtb, BOOT.BIN, Linux kernel and put them together to build the full SD card image.
